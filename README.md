## Contribute 🤝
### Branches
Pull requests should be composed of type and branch name.\
Branch name must be spaced by "-".\
The types might be:
- feature - For new features
- fix - For adjustments (both bugfixes and hotfixes)
- release - For release branches

Example: feature/navbar-mobile

### Commits
Commits should be structured as <type>(<branch-name>): <commit description>\
Example: feature(navbar-mobile): adding smooth scroll

### Default Branches
- master - Most stable code
- develop - Most recently developed

### Pull requests
Pull requests must have good descriptions.\
The three main topics of the description are:
- What I did
- How I did
- How to test

Of course it's not mandatory, sometimes it won't make sense to add some of these.\
But add descriptive PRs with pictures and referencing code when needed.

## Methodology 🚀
Based on SCRUM, we're having 1 week sprints with sprint planning, sprint retrospective, sprint review and dailies.

We're using Github's projects as a Kanban board for the project and Trello to manage other stuff related to the discipline.
